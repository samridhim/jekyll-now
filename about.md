Hello World! I am a Computer Engineering student at Pune Institute of Computer Technology. I have been passionate about computers since as long as I can remember. I love learning new programming languages and how things work behind the code. I also happen to agree with most people when they call me a geek. 

### More Information

I also happen to write about my life, [in my other blog](samridhimaheshwari.blogspot.com).
