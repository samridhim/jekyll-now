Hello World! I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [PhonePe](https://www.phonepe.com/en/). I have been passionate about computers since as long as I can remember. I love learning new programming languages and finding out how things work behind the code. I also happen to agree with most people when they call me a geek. When I am not doing work or sleeping, I am probably on a reddit binge or cooking.

### More Information

I also happen to write about my life, [in my other blog](http://www.samridhimaheshwari.blogspot.com).
