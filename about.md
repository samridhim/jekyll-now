Hello World! I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [PhonePe](https://www.phonepe.com/en/). I have done my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from Pune University. I like developing scalable systems, machine learning, genomics and astronomy. When I am not doing work or sleeping, I am probably on a reddit binge or cooking. 

### More Information

I also happen to write about my life, [in my other blog](http://www.samridhimaheshwari.blogspot.com).

### My Resume

Available upon request.
