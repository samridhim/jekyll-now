title: What 3 years in PICT have taught me.
---

Well, 3 years have gone by. It seems like yesterday I was reading up answers on Quora, figuring out if I should take admission here or not. And I did, I took the leap of faith, hoping it wasn't one of my many bad decisions, I took admission here. And do I regret it? No. But do I wish it wasn't as hellish as it is now? Definitely.
