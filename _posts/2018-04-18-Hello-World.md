title: My first blog post.
---

Hi. I am Samridhi Maheshwari, a final year student at Pune Institute of Computer Technology. I usually just blog about my life experiences but I recently thought about starting a technical blog covering all my tech-experiences and the projects I have worked on. I will be writing blogs on the valuable things I have learnt while doing my projects soon. Keep watching this space and please check out the 'About Me' tab for contact information.
