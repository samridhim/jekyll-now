### Analysing Gene Regulation with Deep Learning
The influence of genomic sequence on patterns of histone modification associated with gene expression and chromatin programming is called sequence bias, and it suggests that the mechanisms responsible for global histone modifications may interpret genomic sequence in various ways.

In this research project we undertake the task of finding such sequence biases using Deep Learning. Specifically, we train a Convolutional Neural Network to detect patterns in DNA Sequences which are underlying certain histone marks.

### Stock Trend Prediction
Used stock index data like Dow Jones to predict the trend of the stock prices going up or down. Features were RSI and Moving Average which are the technical indicators of a stock. Compared the performance of 3 algorithms - Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forests. SVM reported the highest accuracy of 96%   

### Fire Detection System
Built a fire detecter using Raspberry Pi. It detects CO level and notifies user through mail and SMS. Also pushed the data onto Thingspeak API for doing data visualisation like plotting histograms, etc. 

### Spotify Analysis
Mined the data from Spotify's API and removed the song qualities such as loudness, timbre, excitement, etc. Then I plotted the data using matplotlib and ran a K-Means clustering algorithm to classify my songs into different categories. 

### Olympian
An android app which calculates calories using distance ran, speed of running, weight & height of the person. A catalog is also provided in-app with various Exercise GIF's. Voice commands are also present while performing exercises.
