### Analysing Gene Regulation with Deep Learning
The influence of genomic sequence on patterns of histone modification associated with gene expression and chromatin programming is called sequence bias, and it suggests that the mechanisms responsible for global histone modifications may interpret genomic sequence in various ways.

In this research project we undertake the task of finding such sequence biases using Deep Learning. Specifically, we train a Convolutional Neural Network to detect patterns in DNA Sequences which are underlying certain histone marks.

### Stock Trend Prediction
Predicts whether the stock index will trend up or down for the next day using historical data.

### Fire Detection System
Built a fire detecter using Raspberry Pi. It detects CO level and notifies user through mail and SMS. Also pushed the data onto Thingspeak API. 

### Spotify Analysis
I mined the data from spotify's web api of top artists and removed the song qualities such as loudness, timbre, excitement, etc. Then I plotted the data using matplotlib and ran a K-Means clustering algorithm to classify my songs into different categories. 

### Olympian
An android app which calculates calories using distance ran, speed of running, weight & height of the person. A catalog with various Exercise GIF's is also provided with voice commands.
